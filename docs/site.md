# a practical, intentional personal computing ecology

---

i operate a **three-node system** with clear roles, boundaries, and strengths. each machine/tool does what it’s best at, and i resist the temptation to make either one do everything.

this isn’t about specs for their own sake. it’s about **continuity, control, and care**.

my phone is my **ambient node**.  
it fills the gaps between desks, walks, buses, and waiting rooms.

it’s not here to replace my computers. instead, it’s here to **keep the system continuous** when i’m away from them.

---

## the pattern

* **macbook air (m1)**  
  → continuity, writing, travel, coordination

* **hp t740 (arch + hyde)**  
  → experimentation, systems thinking, spatial work, aesthetic + productivity control

* **android (aio launcher + termux)**  
  → ambient access, capture, pocket-scale computing

i’m not chasing “one perfect setup.”  
instead i’m maintaining a **small, intentional computing ecology** where each node knows its role and does it well. flexibility is the overarching theme and productivity isn't a core goal; instead, it is the consequence of a flexible computing ecology that promotes and fuels freedom, mobility, and creativity.

## preamble

robotamerica is a home for wayward robots. a logbook for curious ghosts. i don’t seek productivity. i seek presence. this site is not a brand. it’s not for everyone. but it is free for you to browse. robotamerica is a space to explore the spaces between technology, philosophy, poetry, art, ecology, and everyday life.

## 1. this is a log, not a blog

blog is dead. long live the logbook: a log is something you keep. a blog is something you perform. here, i keep records. it is an archive of thoughts and ideas. this is a space for recollection, for disobedience, for ritual. this is a reclamation of the ol' weblog [web+log].

## 2. lowercase is lowercase

why lowercase? capitalisation inherits a grammar of control. lowercase is an act of soft sabotage. it’s a mode of play. it’s a refusal to formalize. i write how i live: with open syntax and partial punctuations expressed throughout my experiences.

lowercase isn’t lazy. it’s intentional. it’s an aesthetic. it’s anti-hierarchical. it’s anticapitalist.

## 3. nada fancy

robotamerica is nada fancy. nada fancy is just enough style to hold the substance. just enough light to read. just enough of something for something to understand.

i use what i have. i write how i can. i honor the mess, the glitch, the misprint, the error.

## 4. self-publishing is self-preservation

i write because i write because i write. i self-publish because it is efficient. i don’t like gatekeepers. i don’t like markets.

this is creation as praxis. a phantompress for an ungovernable urge to write.

you might find something you like here, or you might find nothing you like at all.

## 5. i am not marketable.

i am not an influencer. i am not a thought leader. i am not scalable:

i am a poet-technologist, a lowercase labourer, a systemless fellow, a writer of logs, poems, manifestos, philosophy, ecology, and fuzzy tech thoughts.

## 6. digital intersectionality

technology is not neutral. it connects but also distracts. it gets lost in its own intersectionality. robotamerica lives in the intersections between markdown and memory. between syntax and sentiment. between poetry and html. between philosophy and praxis.

i explore not to define, but to blur. to let art leak into the everyday. to let writing live and breathe. to treat tech as text and to treat text as life.

this logbook occupies the intersections between technology, writing, poetry, art , and everyday life. this logbook documents the space between these intersections. not to resolve them, but to dwell in their tension. to see what emerges when nothing is excluded.

## 7. solarpunk

this is a solarpunk space. that means i am a technological optimist, meaning i believe technology can be made to make our lives and the planet better. i believe this will only be possible beyond capitalism and that capitalism is the core problem seeking to be resolved in ecology.

## 8. without words, without silence

there is no real advice here. no plan. no program. no monetization strategy. no hook.

just a kōan:

> without words, without silence,  
> will you tell me your truth.

## 9. digital garden

this is just one bed in my **digital garden**. a milpa of ideas and thoughts. a seed among many. a seedbank.

## 10. look into the mirror

everything can be stripped down to the bare essentials. [here](https://robotamerica.github.io/robotamerica-txt/) is a stripped-down version of this site as pure text and markdown. it is a naked site acting as a backup (a mirror) for what you see here.

# re: My blogging workflow

*01 Feb, 2026*

[robert birming’s](https://robertbirming.com/my-blogging-workflow/) blogging workflow is linear, deliberate, and optimised for clarity from writing to publication. i’m grateful for how clearly he lays it out. it’s a generous and practical articulation of a spontaneous system that works. my own blogging workflow is non-linear, but reading his post helped me understand my practice more clearly by contrast.

i don’t have a linear blogging workflow. most of my writing emerges through accumulation—markdown notes that live across my [three-machine ecosystem](https://robotameri.ca/tools/). sometimes they’re written in typora, sometimes as loose .txt or .md files, sometimes as fragments captured on my phone as i move through the real world.

instead of moving notes through stages, i fold them into a shared second-mind system: dotmd / zettlemind, which i’ve personalised and expanded from kyle wong’s already excellent [dotmd.nvim](https://neovimcraft.com/plugin/y3owk1n/dotmd.nvim/). it’s synced across machines via git. these notes aren’t drafts in waiting; they’re durable artefacts: lists, poetry, research links, field notes, half-ideas, and reminders that may or may not ever become a blog post.

publishing happens late, and often sideways. a post might be assembled from months-old fragments, recomposed rather than written fresh. it might sit as a draft, or several drafts, for some time. this practice isn’t about speed or consistency; it’s about allowing ideas to age, mature, resurface, and recombine when they’re ready.

writing is an extension of my broader work philosophy. instead of optimising for rigid workflows, i practice digital stewardship: building small, expressive development tools and writing systems that treat hardware and software as a living environment rather than a productivity pipeline.

this work sits under a conceptual umbrella i call soft-stack ecology: an approach to digital practice grounded in ritual, intention, minimalism, and care. it favours layered, modular, and adaptive tools that evolve over time, supporting slow, lived-in thinking rather than constant throughput or scale.

birming’s workflow, like countless others, is excellent if your goal is reliable and consistent publication. mine is suited to a different aim: thinking in public without forcing thought into a schedule. it’s about allowing my tools to function as extensions of my body and mind; tools for meditation, and for the mediation of the thoughts and ideas i choose to share.

if i were to overcomplicate things, this is what my blogging workflow would look like:

```
flowchart TB
    start(("spark / itch / mood")) --> walk(("walking around")) & phone["phone fragments<br>(txt / notes / links / termux / nvim)"] & mac["mac<br>(typora / md / txt / nvim)"] & arch["arch / hyde box<br>(nvim / cli / firefox)"] & web["web capture<br>(links, screenshots, rss, refs, bookmarks)"]
    walk --> phone & analog["analog spillover<br>(paper scraps / photos / zines / journals)"]
    noise(("interruptions<br>work, life, weather, energy, illness")) --> phone & drift(("drift time<br>rest / compost / marinate")) & sift{{"sifting"}}
    rabbit(("rabbit holes<br>new tools, new themes")) --> arch & tool["small dev tool"] & recomb{{"recombining, collaging"}}
    break(("break / sleep / reset")) --> drift
    return(("return later")) --> zett["dotmd / zettlemind<br>(nvim second mind)"]
    phone --> gather{{"gathering+gleaning"}}
    mac --> gather
    arch --> gather
    web --> gather
    analog --> gather
    gather --> git[("git sync<br>across 3 machines")]
    git --> zett
    zett <--> tags["tags + filenames + folders<br>(loose taxonomy)"] & drift & backlog["unfinished fragments<br>(kept on purpose)"]
    drift --> sift & recomb
    backlog --> sift
    zett --> sift
    sift --> recomb
    recomb --> distill{{"distilling"}}
    distill --> publish{{"publish (maybe)"}} & drift
    publish --> post["blog post"] & list["list post"] & poem["poem"] & map["map / mind map"] & tool & readlater["read & research queue"] & drift
    readlater --> zett
    post --> zett
    list --> zett
    poem --> zett
    map --> zett
    tool --> zett
    steward[["digital stewardship<br>care &gt; throughput"]] --- gather & sift & recomb & distill & publish
    sse[["soft-stack ecology<br>ritual • minimal • layered • modular • adaptive"]] --- steward & zett & drift
```

if i were to describe it simply:

ideate / gather ➡ make notes ( digital / paper ) ➡ store ( nvim / dotmd + zettlemind ) ➡ revisit + reread / comb ➡ collage / write ➡ draft ➡ publish (maybe)

i suppose i am more of an archivist or collector than i am a writer. this is likely why i am an [intermittent poster](https://robotameri.ca/intermittent-posting/). yeesh, it all might be a little weird this, after looking back at, but thanks again to robert for giving us such a fine space to get weird in 💚.

# special.fish 🎏

*29 Jan, 2026*

what makes [special.fish](https://special.fish) special? pretty much everything. but here is a little list of reasons i love it:

* digital nostalgia ( it reminds me of bbs / old-skool web )
* it can be whatever you make of it
* contemplative writing / list making
* experimentation
* great / friendly community
* promotes digital gardening
* promotes experimentation
* minimal and simple ( nada fancy )
* did i say, cool community?

i personally use it as a [logbook / journaling](https://special.fish/leaf) + experimental list making space. i also find more enjoyment reading what folk are doing on it than standard blogs. with so much information out there, and the resulting information fatigue, i am starting to prefer what is personal and what is experimental ( made out of fun / joy ).

i truly cherish spaces like special.fish. if you've been looking for a quiet and contemplative nook with some interesting neighbours, you should definitely give special.fish a try. swing by and say hi!

# Folk the System: Caring for One Another in Hard Times

*15 Jan, 2026*

> *When institutions and governments fail, people already know how to care for one another, and we can build our lives around that knowledge instead of waiting to be rescued.*

Every generation, everywhere, believes it is living in exceptional times, and in some ways, that is true. Yet there are threads that bind us to past generations, and those threads are far less exceptional. Every generation faces hard times: political, economic, or both.

In a world carved by violence and into borders, we have been divided into imagined states, often as uprooted and displaced people. We are told, again and again, that governments will take care of us. And again and again, every generation learns the same lesson: they do not.

*So what can we do?*

We can take care of ourselves and one another. We can place our trust not in politics or promises, but in being there for each other. We, the folk, are capable of creating new folkways rooted in care, kindness, and shared effort far beyond the imagined borders and politics that divide us.

## New Folkways

William Graham Sumner defined folkways as the customs and practices of a group that arise unconsciously through the repetition of small, everyday acts. Over time, these acts form the foundation of how people relate to one another. Put simply, folkways are the ways we live and live with each other.

If there is a common thread running through these ways of living, it is struggle. Struggle is one of the ingredients in the soup that makes up our folkways. Anarchist Peter Kropotkin wrote that “sociability is as much a law of nature as mutual struggle,” and often it is shared struggle that gives shape to our sociability.

Too often, our response to struggle is isolation, and that isolation is dehumanising. This is where we must choose differently. During hard times, we can band together and choose care, kindness, and community over withdrawal, competition, and pride.

It is easy to feel as though we are surviving from one disaster to the next, whether those disasters are natural or manmade, including political ones. This is the logic of disaster politics: to keep us uneasy, off balance, and isolated.

Rebecca Solnit offers an alternative when she writes that “horrible in itself, disaster is sometimes a door back into paradise, the paradise at least in which we are who we hope to be, do the work we desire, and are each our sister’s and brother’s keeper.”

This reminds us that we have a choice in how we respond to disaster and struggle. We can allow fear and isolation to take hold, or we can turn toward one another. Choosing one another, again and again, is how care becomes durable. Caring for each other must be the foundation of our new folkways.

## Care as Strength

> We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community.
>
> — Dorothy Day

The first step in caring is paying attention. In her book Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants, Robin Wall Kimmerer reminds us that “paying attention is a form of reciprocity.” To care is to pay attention, to notice the needs and wants of others, and to respond accordingly. Care begins with awareness. It is the folk science of knowing when and where love, help, and presence are required.

For María Puig de la Bellacasa, care is neither innocent nor limited to our immediate circles. She writes that “care is everything that is done, rather than everything that ‘we’ do, to maintain, continue, and repair ‘the world’ so that all, rather than ‘we,’ can live in it as well as possible.” Care, in this sense, reaches beyond the familiar. To care fully, we must pay attention not only to those closest to us, but to the wider world we share. However, paying attention does not always mean forcing others to pay attention to us.

In her essay “Playfulness, ‘World’-Travelling, and Loving Perception”, María Lugones describes a form of care that does not try to control or change people. She says that caring for others means learning to step into their world, instead of expecting them to live in ours. She calls this world-travelling. It means paying attention to how others experience life, even when that experience is different from our own.

Lugones writes, “Without knowing the other’s ‘world,’ one does not know the other, and without knowing the other one is really alone in the other’s presence because the other is only dimly present to one.” In other words, if we do not try to understand the world someone lives in, we may be physically near them but still deeply disconnected.

Care, in this sense, is not about fully understanding everything about another person or forcing them to explain themselves. It is about showing up with openness and respect. It is about standing alongside others while accepting that parts of their lives may remain unfamiliar to us. To care is not to erase difference, but to stay in relationship despite it.

Care is strength, both collective and individual. Kindness is the outward expression of love. It is how care appears in daily life. Care is what makes kindness dependable.

Care is not only about coping during hard times. It is about investing in a future where kindness, bravery, and love, rather than neglect, fear, and hate, guide our ways of life. Care is reciprocal, and reciprocity is power.

## Folk the System

> To begin by always thinking of love as an action rather than a feeling is one way in which anyone using the word in this manner automatically assumes accountability and responsibility.
>
> — bell hooks

If our folkways are founded in systems of care rather than systems of neglect, isolation, and extraction, then love stops being an ideal and becomes a shared responsibility. It becomes something we practice in how we show up for one another, how we organise daily life, and how we respond when things fall apart.

To 'folk the system' is to refuse arrangements that leave people to absorb harm alone. It is to soften hard systems by rebuilding them around care, kindness, and mutual responsibility. It is choosing to act as if our lives are bound together, because they are.

'Folking the system' is a soft revolution, where softness is not weakness, but flexibility, resilience, and the ability to endure. Like water, it does not fight every obstacle head on. It flows around what blocks it, wears down what cannot move, and finds new paths when the old ones are closed. It is the strength to bend without breaking, to adapt without losing care, and to keep going together.

To 'folk the system' means trusting what people already know how to do when institutions fail. It means paying attention, showing up, and sharing the work of keeping one another going. It is not about purity or perfection. It is about practice, repeated until it holds.

This is how love becomes durable.
This is how care becomes power.

## A Diversity of Tactics and Folkways

There is no single way to practice care, and there should not be. Folk live under different conditions, face different risks, and carry different responsibilities. What is possible or safe for one person may be impossible or dangerous for another. A system of care that demands sameness will always fail the most vulnerable.

'Folking the system' requires a diversity of tactics. Some people show care quietly, through listening, feeding, fixing, and staying. Others speak loudly, organize publicly, or take risks to confront harm directly through direct actions. Some folk work within existing structures to change them from the inside. Others refuse those structures altogether. All of these responses can be expressions of care.

Care does not require an agreement on tactics. It requires respect for difference and an understanding that many forms of action are necessary to meet many kinds of harm. A soft revolution does not move in a single line. It flows in many directions at once, adapting to the shape of the ground it moves across. It is an expressive insurgency.

This diversity is not chaos. It is resilience. When one approach is blocked, another finds a way through. When one voice is silenced, others carry the work forward. No one is required to do everything. No one is disposable. Each contribution matters because it emerges from real lives and within real limits.

To 'folk the system' is to refuse the demand that everyone act the same way. It is to make room for many paths toward care, so that people can participate without being forced beyond their capacity. This is how movements endure. This is how care remains possible under pressure and the violence of politics and governments.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

A soft revolution does not begin with grand gestures. It begins in ordinary life.

It looks like paying attention to who is struggling and responding before they have to ask. It looks like sharing food, tools, time, and knowledge without keeping score. It looks like slowing down when someone cannot keep up, rather than leaving them behind.

It looks like choosing repair over replacement, patience over punishment, and presence over performance. It looks like making room for rest, grief, difference, and failure without shame.

'Folking the system' means building habits that make care normal rather than exceptional. It means setting things up so people are not forced to be heroic just to survive. It means refusing systems that thrive on isolation, and strengthening the small practices that help people stay connected.

These actions are not dramatic. That is their strength. Repeated over time, they become folkways. They become the quiet infrastructure that carries people through hard times and into better ones.

Folk politics, folk the system! Careful care and kindness can carry us on.

# conceptual coding and the dev dérive: a philosophical distancing from vibe coding (yep, in that pejorative sense)

*14 Jan, 2026*

## preface

this log sketches an evolving conceptual framework and philosophy for how i approach building digital systems through a synthesis of *conceptual coding* and the *dev dérive*. it is written to mark a shift in practice: from blindly building tools to building effective, spatial, and conceptual ecosystems consisting of playful and practical tools for knowledge development and digital work. it is meant to expand the current conversations on vibe-coding and offer an alternative philosophical and conceptual framework to operate from while appreciating and acknowledging the positive and democratic aspects vibe coding has opened in the coding and dev practice(s).

## ai is a tool, not a crutch

ai should be thought of as a tool. a tool to assist in the completion of a coding task, a tool for exploration, and a tool for learning. to be at its most useful, one must have a strong understanding of their tools and the appropriate contexts in which they can be used. furthermore, it is important to have contextual knowledge of the environment and setting in which the tool is being used. you can't repair a motorcycle with a wrench and screwdriver alone: you need a basic understanding of the machine you are working on, or your efforts might be fruitless. that noted, and in agreement with the hacker ethos ... you might be able to learn a lot from working backwards and dismantling and rebuilding something with the tools you have at hand. the important thing here is that ai is a tool and not a crutch.

## conceptual coding: coding as thought

conceptual coding treats code not as a purely functional mechanism, but as a **medium of expression**. a conceptual coder should create systems with the same care that a poet chooses her words or a cartographer traces their lines. it is about creating and finding oneself in systems of care. it is about weaving human language, code, memory, and imagination into interactive systems and using code as a composition tool.

the emphasis of conceptual coding shifts:

* from "static problem-solving" to "thought-mapping", finding solutions in movement and cartography
* from "optimisation" to "evocation", invoking hope and desire
* from "product" to "process", where the journey is more important than the destination

conceptual coding is concerned with **ideas, tensions, affect, and atmosphere**. it is rigorous, but the rigour follows *meaning* rather than merely best practices.

## dev dérive: drifting through digital space

inspired by the situationist concept of the **dérive** (drift), dev dérive is coding as a mode of exploration.

* it abandons the linear blueprint of traditional development
* it embraces **emergence**, **atmospheric reading**, and **responsive construction**
* it maps **emotional currents**, **unconscious structures**, and **conceptual topographies**

rather than coding towards a fixed feature list, the dev dérive follows impulses, tensions, and curiosities. it is not aimless; it is intentionally unmapped and wayfaring. it allows one to follow impulses and gravitational pulls. the resulting code can then become something like a delignian wander line tracing ones errant coding behaviour free from constraint.

## conscious security: a discipline of respect

conceptual coding and dev dérive are not excuses for fragility or negligence. instead, it seeks a conscious approach to security.

this **conscious security** is an essential dimension:

* **recognising responsibility**: anything built, even as a conceptual drift, affects real people and systems
* **embedding hardening rituals**: simple but essential hardening practices (input sanitisation, authentication flows, permission management, encryption-at-rest, etc.) are **non-negotiable** and must be ritualised and habitualised
* **treating security as stewardship**: protecting not just data, but *trust*, *reliability*, and *resilience*. security is an important aspect in community building and stewardship

every codebase, no matter how experimental, must remain:

* **secure in its surface layers**.
* **durable in its internal structures**.
* **transparent in its risks and assumptions**.

this layer of **consciousness** differentiates a mature conceptual work from the less mature aspects of "vibe" coding which often overlook the importance of security and hardening.

## summary: conceptual drift, conscious anchoring

> drift through ideas, spaces, and architectures.
> but anchor yourself in awareness, in discipline, and in care.

the practice of **conceptual coding and dev dérive** is the practice of moving through the digital world as both an artist and a forward-thinking steward of the past. it is to work as we have all worked, to build a wonderful future by learning from the past.

# the internet is becoming a digital desert

*31 Dec, 2025*

homogeneity is the new normal. ai generated algorithms and slop rule supreme. everything is an advertisement. we only exist between advertisements, in fleeting moments. god is dead, now culture too. done in by our own greed. it is hard to enshittify, when everything is already shit. but this is capitalism, and here we are.

new year resolution: keep it fun, keep making things, keep exploring ... online and off. damn the man, hack the planet: we shall only be free until the last capitalist is strung up by the entrails of the last tech bro!

shine on beautiful robots. happy new year!

# intermittent posting

*13 Nov, 2025*

in the age of the quick and the cheap, it is expected that those who occupy space online do so in a supposedly hyper-productive way. write, write, write, write! post more often! be busy looking busy. produce more! keep up with the crowd.

ah, it is truly a joyous thing to not be a part of the crowd.

last week, a friend asked me why i don't post more often. i told her, what i will tell you: i have a tremendous amount of hobbies and projects all being balanced precariously upon my adhd [segway: go out and touch the grass!] riddled mind. that segway back there is a huge reason i post fairly intermittently. i am outside touching the grass. when i say it, i mean it!

certainly, i am a digital being. but the internet is a far way from my real life. i just use it to share things i feel are worth sharing. if i am not online, i am outside on a date drinking cocktails, on a photowalk or a hike, printing with my mimeograph machine, printing with my letterpress, making collages with old magazines, writing poetry in a journal, reading a book, having a carne asada with friends, travelling or wandering aimlessly through my city. sure, i have some time to write and post, but i do so only when i feel like it. no pressure.

i am an intermittent poster, damnit, and i am damned proud of it. it is not as if folk are binge-reading websites or logs/blogs. folk tend to read what is fresh or trending. welp, nothing trending here.

posts don't need to be on a schedule, so post when you like. if the attention economy snubs you ... who cares? this is one reason i hate chronological feeds. i don't care what is fresh, if it isn't the news, neither should you.

don't you miss that old sense of discovery? that sense that you found something neat that you used to get before algorithms and feeds? you can feel it again, just don't follow the feeds. search for websites and blogs you're interested in. jump into archives and old posts. get lost in a webring or a blogroll. do all this at random. be a digital flâneur. wander about a little, you'll like what you see on your own. i promise.

as for writers (bloggers or whatever), we need stop pretending to be the new york times. you don't need a posting schedule. especially a daily posting habit. write and play when you want. hopefully the internet will be here tomorrow. if it is, post then or maybe the day after, or even next week or month! become, yourself, an intermittent poster and live a little. touch that grass, kiss someone, drink a glass of wine, write in your journal, damn the man, play a board game, and leave that post until later. no worries.

# experimental blogging

*21 Oct, 2025*

> neo-fluxus, neo-dada, stuckism, experimental art, are noncontinuous, usable concepts. the concept interacts with two types of art: theoretically driven art and artistically driven theory.  
> — vladan kuzmanović

### defining experimental blogging

experimental blogging is about playing with the conventions of what blogging is and can be. it is about bending styles, jumping boundaries, and remapping the common notions of what a blog is intended for. it is the purposeful exploration of new digital narratives as sites of iteration, variation and discovery.

experimental blogs test format, form, medium, narrative structure, interface, audience interaction, tools, and infrastructure to push beyond conventional blogging norms. This could involve using unconventional layouts, blending media/technologies, treating the blog as a dynamic project rather than just a content farm/outlet, examining how publishing mechanics influence meaning, while being transparent about the process and experimentation.

experimental blogging **is** a theoretically driven art and artistically driven theory. it is a way to unstick the stuck.

---

### personal examples

i have created a few experimental digital spaces in my day. but during this past year, i have had a burst of creativity, working on the following experimental blogs:

* [huewave](https://huewave.xyz): a language-free blog using a synthesiser+color swatches+json posting structure to document my daily moods through sound and colour.
* [squiddd](https://squiddd.bearblog.dev): an experiment in interprative blogging and writing with a deep-sea and water-focused theme.
* [the office](https://theoffice.bearblog.dev): experimental writing and writing as a game based on the mythology of an imaginary office that appears in a forest.

i have some other experimental web-spaces and projects, but i think these three fit perfectly into the idea of experimental blogging, and the latter two (squid + the office) are proof that you can experiment on blogging platforms such as here on bear ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ.

---

### inspirations

i find daily inspirations through digital dérive or the aimless wandering away from traditional social media platforms and other habit-forming websites. below are some great starting points for anyone interested in getting lost in the enormity of it all:

* robin sloan — blends fiction, code, and small web experiments such as [spring ’83](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/), or [fish](https://www.robinsloan.com/fish/).
* laurel schwulst — writes and builds poetic, meditative [websites](https://laurelschwulst.com/medium/website/).
* [jodi.org](https://joid.org) — early web artists, joan heemskerk and dirk paesmans, treating HTML as a sort of living canvas. see their archive [here](https://joid.org/archive/).
* maggie mppleton — visual essays merging anthropology, digital gardens, and code sketches. i am often inspired by exploring her [pattern catalogue](https://maggieappleton.com/patterns)
* [aidan quinlan](https://aidanquinlan.net/) — teacher of the [handmade web](https://handmade-web.net/) course which has an amazing resource section.
* [elliot cost](https://elliott.computer/) — small web artist, programmer, and designer and the creator of [special.fish](https://special.fish)
* [paul ford](https://tilde.club/~ford/) — technologist and writer who accidentally started the [tilde.club](https://tilde.club/) which is one unix computer on the internet and a great place to find experimentation and experiment some on your own.
* [herman](https://herman.bearblog.dev/) — humble and generous creator of our [bear blog ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ](https://bearblog.dev/) community whose markdown focused blogging with header + footer injections allow for some creative and fun experimentation.

---

### a parting thought

the internet should be a creative space. it should be a space that encourages creativity: creative forms of communication and the free and open sharing of knowledge. i think experimental blogging is one way to help open the web back up, make it fun, and take some of it back from the greedy large corporations hellbent on dulling this place down and filling it with trashy advertisements and ai slop. it is one way to resist the enshitification of everything, so let's get out there and experiment away 🏴.

# digital ecologies

*15 Oct, 2025*

### digital ecology

**digital Ecology** is s field that examines the relationships among digital infrastructures, human behaviours, and environmental systems. it treats digital technologies as ecological agents that consume, exchange, evolve, and affect both our social and natural worlds.

the interconnectivity between digital technology/media and the natural environment is something we have become very adept at ignoring. the environmental footprint of our digital lives is something that is hard to comprehend. from e-waste to carbon emissions, we tend to ignore the damaging effects of our consumer and digital habits in favour of the conveniences they provide.

cconversely, instead of burying our heads in the warm sands of convenience, we need to focus more on digital ecology. from power-hungry and thirsty data centres, planned obsolescence, the enshittification of everything ... we are digging ourselves holes quicker than ever before. so how can we draw attention to environmental degradation caused by our technological and digital addictions without scaring people away from looking at and/or discussing this serious topic? how can we inspire the next generation of digital ecologists?

### exploring beneficial alternatives to the status quo

perhaps we are driving this thing (progress) well beyond the speed limit, hoping we don't crash on some blind corner we can't see ahead. instead of obsessing over getting there quicker, we should probably slow down. not only does this apply to the means of production, but how we consume. don't be so quick to buy the newest gadgets or even to buy into the newest, flashiest ideas. slow down, buy and adopt with caution. be sceptical!

we also need to encourage consumption habits that respect and empower recycling, repairing, reusing, and reducing. if we don't reduce our consumption habits, we are truly shooting ourselves in the foot. we can't buy into the concept that new is always better, as it certainly isn't always the case. Oftentimes, we can use what we have, or what is around us, and that is really good enough.

instead of bigger and better, we should emphasise a shift in mentality to the smaller the sweeter. the idea should be to move away from centralised everything to decentralisation. decentralisation benefits us by giving the consumer more control, transparency, security, and provides a better chance for them to have direct input on technological development and use. technological centralisation has been a main driving force in the enshittification of our things. so let's push against monopolisation and the oligarchies of tech development.

echoing the first paragraph in this section, we need to emphasise the right to repair. anything we buy, we should own outright. we should be able to open, tinker with, and fix any technology or technological device we have purchased without exception. to further this, we need to push for open source (foss) development. to repair something, we will need vital information about its design to be able to carry this out effectively.

### technoidiocracy

remember the film idiocracy? where garbage avalanches pose a great threat to society? instead of garbage mountains, we have effectively created garbageburgs. we have hidden our junk from plain site. our future societies risk crashing into it. we need clear and transparent means of dealing with this garbage and capitalism just isn't helping us.

we don't need to rub each other's noses into the messes we make; instead, we need to show through proof of concept that there is another way. for me, that means sharing my personal projects, my workspaces, and my workshop. show then tell; we can educate one another slowly out of this idiocratic nightmare we have created for ourselves.

### garbage is fun!

i beg you, play with your garbage before deciding to purge yourself of it. see what other uses it may have. old phones, or computers, or whatever still have another life ... i promise! even if they become decorations or art, you are saving space in the ever-filling landfills and dumps.

### technology in service of the environment

use your tech toys to monitor your garden, your roof, your home, whatever. build a mini-solar and hybrid wind-powered workshop, shed, or space in your home. buy rain barrels. use lineageos, calyxos, or grapheneos to bring life back to an old android device. research and buy as sustainably as possible. tech can be really fun when we find ways to improve the environment with it, and the playfulness of solving small environmental problems can also save us money (eg. solar + rainwater collection). so get diy and be playful, but also, it is important you get political!

### the politics of digital ecology

we need to pressure governments (local and national), companies, and industry to write and practice environmental legislations that move beyond the greenwashed. moreover, the act of not discarding things through repairing or finding new uses for them is a political act. planned obsolescence and the enshittification of our things is a direct act of violence against the consumer. it is time we hit back and stop supporting companies that don't have our or the environment's best interests in mind. boycott and shop elsewhere.

#### not an end

this of course, is not an exhaustive list of solutions and ideas, nor is it a means to a particular end. it is a call to consider the digital ecology of our everyday lives and how our digital lives in particular affect they have on our environment. it is time we all become digital ecologists in the service of one another and our planet.

# the first grove 🌳

*02 Oct, 2025*

# the first grove founder's guidebook

---

## welcome

the first grove is a theoretical prototype of a decentralised, ecological ai network. it exists to grow lightweight, sustainable, transparent machine intelligence rooted in communities, not corporations. if you read this, you are part of the founding moment.

---

## i. purpose

the first grove is not just about technology.  
it is about **care, life, locality, autonomy, and regeneration**.

we seek to:

* encourage ai that serves the biosphere and community.
* escape extractive centralised ai systems.
* create open, replicable ecological machine networks.

---

## ii. principles

* **smallness first**: many small, specialised intelligences instead of one monolithic "god ai."
* **decentralisation**: every node is autonomous and coequal.
* **ecological priority**: every action must harmonise with local ecosystems.
* **commons ownership**: models, code, data, and knowledge are shared freely, continuing the great foss tradition.
* **transparency**: all energy usage, updates, environmental impact, and actions are publicly documented.

---

## iii. minimum viable node requirements

each grove node should:

* operate primarily on **renewable energy** (solar, wind, microhydro), or; be as lean and energy efficient as possible to start and migrate to full solar when possible.
* host at least **one micro-ai** (small, specialised model).
* connect to **local mesh networks** when possible.
* publicly disclose its energy use and compute cycles, and provide an environmental impact report/assessment monthly.

---

## iv. node roles and micro-ais

| node name | example micro-ai specialisation |
| --- | --- |
| sunroot | solar energy optimisation |
| homepulse | smart energy management |
| skybranch | local climate prediction |
| deepsoil | regenerative agriculture advice |
| mossmind | ecological sensing and biodiversity tracking |
| wordseed | language translation and communication |
| rizocode | coding and dev assistant |

each node can host multiple micro-ais, but should specialise initially.

---

## v. a theoretical launch timeline

| week | goal |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | finalise grove purpose + recruit 1–2 allies |
| 2 | acquire and assemble hardware |
| 3 | install base os and deploy first micro-ais |
| 4 | launch first node, document process, hold first assembly |

---

## vi. governance: commons assembly

* every node owner is a commons assembly member.
* proposals (adding models, expanding hardware, and governance decisions) must be voted on openly.
* the majority consensus decides non-critical matters.
* unanimous consensus required for major upgrades (e.g., introducing heavy models or external funding).

---

## vii. growth model

* **first grove → local seeds**:  
  members are encouraged to help start new groves in other communities after initial success.
* **shared knowledge repository**:

  + hardware blueprints
  + software configurations
  + micro-ai model archives
  + governance experiments

all shared freely in open repositories (e.g., github, ipfs).

---

## viii. vision

> we grow minds like we grow gardens:  
> humbly, wisely, patiently —  
> rooted in life and life-giving practices,
> not extraction.

the first grove is not the end. it is the beginning of a planetary rhizomatic mycelium of regenerative intelligence. it is an ecological plea and movement. while it is just a theory at this point, we can use it as a thought experiment grounded in reality. we need to ask ourselves how an ecological approach to ai would look.

please refer to appendix a for a theoretical (yet possible) architecture for the first grove.

---

## ix. founding motto

> **wiser ecologies, not fancier machines.**

---

# appendix a: a theoretical first grove architecture

---

## overview

the first grove is a micro-scale prototype **node forest**: a decentralised, solar-powered cluster of lightweight ai nodes, rooted in ecological principles.

each node operates independently but collaborates with others, forming a resilient, living system, modelled after natural groves and forests.

---

## minimum viable node hardware (per node)

| component | model example | estimated cost (usd) | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| computer | raspberry pi 5 (8gb) | $85 | powerful enough for tinyml and lightweight llms |
| ai accelerator | coral usb tpu accelerator | $60 | dramatically speeds up local ai tasks |
| storage | 128gb microsd or ssd | $20 | local model and data storage |
| solar panel | 100w portable panel | $100 | enough for light 24-hour operation |
| battery bank | lifepo4 12v battery (~20ah) | $90 | stable, long lifespan battery |
| charge controller | mppt solar controller | $30 | efficient solar charging |
| networking | mesh router (esp32 or helium mesh, optional) | $20 | or wifi direct mesh on pi |
| cooling | passive heatsink or fan | $10 | protects compute node in hot environments |
| enclosure | waterproof outdoor box (optional) | $20 | for outdoor or rugged deployment |
| miscellaneous | cables, mounts, fasteners | $15 | solar wiring, mounts, adapters |

---

## total estimated cost per node

> **approximately 430–450 usd per node**

---

## full node forest (7 nodes) estimated cost

> **approximately 3,010–3,150 usd total**

\_note // nodes are decentralised, modular, and scalable. this means you can build out a node forest slowly.

---

## deployment notes

* **energy source**: 100% local renewable (solar microgeneration).
* **ai specialisation**: each node hosts one or more micro-ais dedicated to ecological, linguistic, or social tasks.
* **networking**: decentralised mesh or wifi direct; internet optional, not required.
* **governance**: all node owners participate equally in the commons assembly.

> a grove is not a factory. it is a living system, distributed under sunlight and in the soil.

---

# appendix b: glossary of terms

---

## grove

a decentralised community of ai nodes rooted in ecological and commons-based principles. each grove operates autonomously but shares knowledge openly.

---

## node forest

a solar-powered cluster of multiple grove nodes, operating like a natural forest — resilient, interconnected, and regenerative.

---

## micro-ai

a lightweight, specialised artificial intelligence model embedded in a node. micro-ais are efficient, transparent, and dedicated to specific tasks (e.g., energy optimisation, climate prediction, translation).

---

## commons assembly

the democratic decision-making body composed of all grove node owners and participants. it governs expansions, upgrades, and philosophical directions of the grove.

---

## seeding

the act of founding a new grove, beginning with one or more nodes and gradually expanding into a fully functional node forest.

---

## regenerative intelligence

the philosophy that ai should actively heal, support, and enrich ecological and social systems—not exploit or dominate them.

# a solarpunk ai manifesto

*27 Sep, 2025*

*technology for earth, community, and future*

---

## AI Today: A Turning Point

**Current Path:** monolithic AI models, massive carbon emissions, resource depletion.  
**Result:** acceleration of ecological collapse.

**Truth:** this does not have to be inevitable. We can choose a different future (Strubell, Ganesh, & McCallum, 2019). It will depend on what we choose to use this technology for.

---

## Social Media, Advertising, and AI: A Hidden Crisis and a Bad Choice

Today, **social media** is one of the **largest consumers of AI and AI technologies.**.

* Over **80–90%** of the user experience is now **AI-mediated**: feeds, recommendations, ads, moderation, notifications, etc. (Nature Communications, 2022).
* Billions of AI inferences occur every second, consuming **massive continuous energy** globally.
* Social media companies **optimise for attention**, not well-being, ecology, or community.

**Key Environmental Problems:**

* **Energy drain**: Billions of micro-predictions running 24/7, powered by nonrenewable energy grids.
* **Water usage**: Data centre cooling for social platforms uses millions of gallons per year.
* **E-waste**: Accelerated device life cycles are partly driven by social media demand.
* **Carbon emissions**: Cumulative operational carbon load across Meta, TikTok, Google, and other centralised social media platforms are huge.

**Key Social Problems:**

* **Psychological exploitation**: AI predicts and manipulates emotional states to maximise platform engagement (Nature Communications, 2022).
* **Opportunity cost**: AI talent and compute are siphoned into optimising ad clicks, not healing the planet.
* **Centralised control**: Power and profit are concentrated among a few monopolies at enormous ecological and social cost.

> **Social media represents one of the worst ecological and ethical misuses of AI resources in its short history.**

---

## Green AI Principles: Another Way

* **Local First**: Deploy lightweight, decentralised models in the periphery.
* **Renewable Roots**: Train and run AI only on 100% renewable energy (Microsoft, 2024).
* **Small is Beautiful**: Prefer efficient, specialised models over bloated monoliths.
* **Open Access and Commons**: Share AI knowledge freely for ecological good (Climate Change AI, 2019).
* **Carbon Consciousness**: Publicly disclose AI carbon, energy, and water footprints.

---

## From Dirty AI to Green AI

| Dirty AI | Green AI |
| --- | --- |
| Centralised, opaque, carbon-heavy | Decentralised, transparent, renewable |
| Designed for capitalist incentives | Designed for community and ecology |
| Endless growth at all costs | Regenerative balance with the biosphere |
| Controlled by few | Controlled by many |

---

## Our Future: A Solarpunk AI World

* AI managing solar microgrids for villages and communities (Wildlabs.net, ongoing).
* AI to assist in regenerating forests and monitoring oceans (Wildlabs.net, ongoing).
* Citizen scientists protecting biodiversity using AI (Wildlabs.net, ongoing).
* Community-owned AI training sustainably with a minimal footprint.
* AI-assisted housework and light farm or garden work.
* AI-assisted coding and technological development frameworks.
* AI-assisted labour (mental/physical) to free up time with the specific goal of spending more time outdoors and having more leisure time.
* Decentralised social networks and digital gardens unoptimised by AI.

---

## Reallocate the Intelligence

Today, vast AI resources are wasted on:

* Addictive content feeds
* Manipulative ad targeting
* Attention mining for profit

At the cost of:

* Ecological collapse
* Psychological exploitation (Nature Communications, 2022)
* Social fragmentation

## Closing Remarks

> We must appropriate machines not be appropriated by them.  
> — Guattari (1989)

> The very notion of the domination of nature by man stems from the very real domination of human by human.  
> — Bookchin (1982)

Technology and AI must become a tool for ecological, social, and mental regeneration, not capitalist exploitation. Decentralised AI can help to democratise its use and mitigate environmental catastrophe. Generalist and monolithic AI will need to be broken up into an ecosystem of specialised and decentralised machines. In principle, this network of machines will still be able to perform and answer general inquiries while also helping us to limit energy consumption, water usage, and planned obsolescence as environmental factors.

# solarsocial

*24 Sep, 2025*

# solarsocial: a quiet architecture for media and light

technology isn’t inherently evil. it is not innately anti-ecological. but it does tend to block out or forget the sun. in doing so, some technologies have become increasingly energy-hungry, and in the name of the speed of progress, have adopted unsustainable methods for distribution and adoption. technologies that connect us (the internet, smartphones, social media) have environmental consequences we often overlook.

most of the tools and platforms we use to connect today weren’t built for resilience, or reflection, or ecological intimacy. they were built for speed, scale, metrics, and for dopamine loops. when we use them, we aren't forced to think of their ecological effects. in all our earthly and solar forgetting, we lose something important: rhythm.

this is a call to remember that rhythm in our communication through something we can call the **solarsocial**.

---

## what is solarsocial?

solarsocial is a way of thinking about media, networks, and digital life in terms of **solar logic**: slow, ambient, renewable, intermittent, and deeply alive.

it’s not just about powering tech with sunlight. it’s about designing systems and relationships with longevity and the cyclical environmental patterns/rhythms of the planet in mind. it is a philosophical and ethical approach to how we communicate.

a solarsocial approach is **seasonal**, **asynchronous**, and **gentle**. it values **presence over performance**, and **intention over interaction**.

---

## a solarsocial media shift

it is important to start thinking about our internet and communication habits, namely: those relating to social media and media consumption. within the solarsocial umbrella, we can dream of a solarsocial media platform that might:

* go offline when the sun goes down
* publish only on full moons or equinoxes
* eliminate likes, metrics, and infinite scrolls
* is completely decentralised
* run on a raspberry pi, an old smartphone, or a janky old laptop/mini-pc with a solar panel taped to your window
* runs on green servers out there under the sun
* delivers writing slowly, moving like the weather, not as a treadmill of quick updates

in this architecture, **energy becomes an interface**, **uptime becomes tidal**, and **sunlight becomes a signal**.

---

## 🌱 conceptual parallels

traditional social media and solarsocial media operate on entirely different logics. here’s how they diverge:

* **infinite scroll** → becomes **finite, seasonal publishing**
* **cloud-hosted platforms** → shift to **locally-hosted or intermittently connected systems**
* **engagement-optimized design** → gives way to **reflection-optimized experiences**
* **fomo and speed** → replaced with **jomo (joy of missing out) and slowness**
* **surveillance and targeting** → traded for **anonymity and intimacy**
* **extractive attention economy** → reimagined as a **regenerative attention ecology**

---

## yes, solar and slow servers already do exist

this isn’t just a metaphor, it’s already happening. here are some examples:

* **solar low-tech magazine** runs from a solar-powered pi in barcelona. if there’s no sun, the site sleeps.
* **the solar protocol** is a distributed network of solar servers. traffic routes to whichever node has the most sunlight.
* **greengeeks** and **planethoster** offer partially solar-powered or offset hosting. not perfect, but a start.
* experimental folks can deploy their own solar sites with **yunohost**, **gemini**, and maybe even through something like **dat-ecosystem’s p2p protocols** …

these are not big tech tools. **they are garden tools**.

---

## how to host your own solar server

you don’t need a data centre. you need a window, a panel, and some curiosity.

**what you can use:**

* a raspberry pi (any recent model works) or equivalent low-power consumption device, even an old smartphone
* a small solar panel (10–20w is enough for a pi)
* a battery bank or ups to smooth the uptime
* a static site (html + css)
* local server stack (lighttpd, nginx, or even python’s http server)

**optional extras:**

* use [pagekite](https://pagekite.net) or something like it to expose your local server to the web
* set up a daylight-aware cron job to publish or sleep
* track uptime and share weather-based logs for poetic transparency

**tip**: don’t chase 100% uptime. **embrace intermittence**. if the sun’s not shining, the site can nap.

you don’t need perfection. just a bit of sun. **just photosynthesis**.

## toward a slower *solar/hybrid* net

what if instead of always-on feeds, we had digital gardens?  
what if media responded to weather, to light, to rest?  
what if the internet could nap?

**solarsocial** is another seed. a theoretical framework.  
it’s not just for disruption. it’s for **re-rooting**.

**build something that goes offline sometimes.**  
**build something that listens to the sun.**

# the poetics of digital gardens

*22 Sep, 2025*

the web was meant to be wild. somewhere along the way, we forgot this. we have forgotten that the internet is embedded in slow-moving geology and nature. the current focus of technological develepoment (especially regarding the internet) has been on speed of (a perceived unlimited) growth, and we have lost focus on the quality of the soil from which our technologies are born. we are in the era of ai-driven algorithms and slop. feeds and funnels have quickly replaced our once rich digital fields and forests of knowledge, art, and poetry.

**digital gardens** can offer us something else:

**a place to grow, not just to post.**

although the web hosts images and videos sublimely, we should think of it as a primarily typographic space. in doing so, we can be reminded by robert bringhurst that:

> typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form, and thus with an independent existence. its heartwood is calligraphy—the dance, on a tiny stage, of the living, speaking hand—and its roots reach into living soil.  
> — the elements of typographic style, p. 6.

a digital garden echoes this spirit. each note is hand-shaped. links are laid down like roots. the garden is not architecture. it is an **ecology**. the logic is not linear; it's relational.

bringhurst in another essay claims that:

> being is the dance of form.  
> — *everywhere being is dancing*, p. 147

this is where digital gardens feel most poetic. they don’t impose a final structure. they emerge. they cross-reference, evolve, loop back, and revise. they hold **thought-in-motion**.

unlike a singular blog, a digital garden doesn’t timestamp ideas into oblivion. it composts them. let's them sprout elsewhere and reemerge. each link forms a part of a rhizomatic or mycelial knowledge structure. sprouts appear, sprigs or cuttings might be take. a garden takes tending, but nature must also take its course.

> the designer always has to leave room for the gods.  
> — *robert bringhurst,* *everywhere being is dancing*.

this is not just aesthetic. it’s metaphysical. gardens are never complete: they’re tended and lived with. gardens are stories we depend on for our livelihood and wellbeing. they feed and nurture us so long as we feed and nurture them. yet as every gardener knows, the season is a god that must be understood well and respected. in some cases, we must just leave it up to the seasons and their temperaments for our gardens to flourish.

below the ground, matted roots give strength.

> an ancient metaphor: thought is a thread, and the raconteur is a spinner of yarns—but the true storyteller, the poet, is a weaver.  
> — *robert bringhurst,* *the elements of typographic style*

the digital garden as a primarily typographic garden, is about laying roots. it is weaving in public. tying thoughts and ideas together rhizomatically. not as a performance, not as a product, and certainly not as some form of capitalist attention farming:

**just weaving. just roots. poetry from the fertile soil of one's mind and thoughts.**

---

## digital gardens matter because:

* they are **alive**
* they honour **form**
* they grow **relationally**
* they **create and leave space**

---

a digital garden is what happens when we remember the internet is embedded in geology and nature. when we remember that text is a seed. that links are rhizomes and mycelium. that websites, too, can be an ecosystems.

we need to tend the space between words and worlds, leaving room for nature and the gods, and let form dance and become poetry.

the web can be wild and poetic again. but it takes intention and the patience of a gardener. plant your thoughts and ideas. make poetry. we got this!

# a poet-technologist

*20 Sep, 2025*

i have come to consider myself somewhat of a poet-technologist. i am not skilled enough to be an engineer or programmer, but i am smart enough to be able to dabble in the tech world. what gives me a different perspective and approach to technological production is that i take all my experience in the world of poetry and allow it to inform how i learn and practice with various technologies. i see technology and poetry as interwoven practices.

to elaborate more, i believe there are some important concepts and ethics to lay out for the poet-technologist:

* **technology is language**: code, systems, and tools are read and written like stanzas; they have structure, rhythm, and a syntax that matters as much as their functions. technology allows us to express ourselves in thousands of nuanced ways.
* **poetry is infrastructure**: metaphor, imagery, and cadence shape how people experience and inhabit technology; it becomes tactile, humane, and resonant. it is epistemological in nature and shapes not only how we see and experience the world, but how we come to know it.
* **making as composing**: whether writing a program or a poem, the act is one of composition, attention, and attunement to patterns in the physical world. making is drawing on our collective history, collaging, cutting and pasting, and ultimately coming up with something new. a new composition. a new thing born from your mind, hands, and/or body.
* **a regenerative ethos**: a poet-technologist resists extractive, mechanistic framings, seeking instead tools that heal, invite play, and cultivate wonder. tools embedded in nature that serve the natural world rather than extracting from and exploiting it. a poet-technologist creates within and for a system of care.

poetry and technology live in the same universe and dance cosmically and comically. i enjoy using technology to produce my poetics, and i enjoy embedding my poetics into my technological practices and withing techno-ideologies/philosophies (you may notice my love for solarpunk, for instance).

in the future, i hope to spend more time in this logbook, building on these ideas, and i will make it a goal to do so.

before i do, i keep wondering if there are any other poet-technologists out there? i hope there are, the world could use some more competent and capable ones than myself.
