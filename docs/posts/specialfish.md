# special.fish 🎏

*29 Jan, 2026*

what makes [special.fish](https://special.fish) special? pretty much everything. but here is a little list of reasons i love it:

* digital nostalgia ( it reminds me of bbs / old-skool web )
* it can be whatever you make of it
* contemplative writing / list making
* experimentation
* great / friendly community
* promotes digital gardening
* promotes experimentation
* minimal and simple ( nada fancy )
* did i say, cool community?

i personally use it as a [logbook / journaling](https://special.fish/leaf) + experimental list making space. i also find more enjoyment reading what folk are doing on it than standard blogs. with so much information out there, and the resulting information fatigue, i am starting to prefer what is personal and what is experimental ( made out of fun / joy ).

i truly cherish spaces like special.fish. if you've been looking for a quiet and contemplative nook with some interesting neighbours, you should definitely give special.fish a try. swing by and say hi!
