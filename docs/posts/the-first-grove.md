# the first grove founder's guidebook

---

## welcome

the first grove is a theoretical prototype of a decentralised, ecological ai network. it exists to grow lightweight, sustainable, transparent machine intelligence rooted in communities, not corporations. if you read this, you are part of the founding moment.

---

## i. purpose

the first grove is not just about technology.  
it is about **care, life, locality, autonomy, and regeneration**.

we seek to:

* encourage ai that serves the biosphere and community.
* escape extractive centralised ai systems.
* create open, replicable ecological machine networks.

---

## ii. principles

* **smallness first**: many small, specialised intelligences instead of one monolithic "god ai."
* **decentralisation**: every node is autonomous and coequal.
* **ecological priority**: every action must harmonise with local ecosystems.
* **commons ownership**: models, code, data, and knowledge are shared freely, continuing the great foss tradition.
* **transparency**: all energy usage, updates, environmental impact, and actions are publicly documented.

---

## iii. minimum viable node requirements

each grove node should:

* operate primarily on **renewable energy** (solar, wind, microhydro), or; be as lean and energy efficient as possible to start and migrate to full solar when possible.
* host at least **one micro-ai** (small, specialised model).
* connect to **local mesh networks** when possible.
* publicly disclose its energy use and compute cycles, and provide an environmental impact report/assessment monthly.

---

## iv. node roles and micro-ais

| node name | example micro-ai specialisation |
| --- | --- |
| sunroot | solar energy optimisation |
| homepulse | smart energy management |
| skybranch | local climate prediction |
| deepsoil | regenerative agriculture advice |
| mossmind | ecological sensing and biodiversity tracking |
| wordseed | language translation and communication |
| rizocode | coding and dev assistant |

each node can host multiple micro-ais, but should specialise initially.

---

## v. a theoretical launch timeline

| week | goal |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | finalise grove purpose + recruit 1–2 allies |
| 2 | acquire and assemble hardware |
| 3 | install base os and deploy first micro-ais |
| 4 | launch first node, document process, hold first assembly |

---

## vi. governance: commons assembly

* every node owner is a commons assembly member.
* proposals (adding models, expanding hardware, and governance decisions) must be voted on openly.
* the majority consensus decides non-critical matters.
* unanimous consensus required for major upgrades (e.g., introducing heavy models or external funding).

---

## vii. growth model

* **first grove → local seeds**:  
  members are encouraged to help start new groves in other communities after initial success.
* **shared knowledge repository**:

  + hardware blueprints
  + software configurations
  + micro-ai model archives
  + governance experiments

all shared freely in open repositories (e.g., github, ipfs).

---

## viii. vision

> we grow minds like we grow gardens:  
> humbly, wisely, patiently —  
> rooted in life and life-giving practices,
> not extraction.

the first grove is not the end. it is the beginning of a planetary rhizomatic mycelium of regenerative intelligence. it is an ecological plea and movement. while it is just a theory at this point, we can use it as a thought experiment grounded in reality. we need to ask ourselves how an ecological approach to ai would look.

please refer to appendix a for a theoretical (yet possible) architecture for the first grove.

---

## ix. founding motto

> **wiser ecologies, not fancier machines.**

---

# appendix a: a theoretical first grove architecture

---

## overview

the first grove is a micro-scale prototype **node forest**: a decentralised, solar-powered cluster of lightweight ai nodes, rooted in ecological principles.

each node operates independently but collaborates with others, forming a resilient, living system, modelled after natural groves and forests.

---

## minimum viable node hardware (per node)

| component | model example | estimated cost (usd) | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| computer | raspberry pi 5 (8gb) | $85 | powerful enough for tinyml and lightweight llms |
| ai accelerator | coral usb tpu accelerator | $60 | dramatically speeds up local ai tasks |
| storage | 128gb microsd or ssd | $20 | local model and data storage |
| solar panel | 100w portable panel | $100 | enough for light 24-hour operation |
| battery bank | lifepo4 12v battery (~20ah) | $90 | stable, long lifespan battery |
| charge controller | mppt solar controller | $30 | efficient solar charging |
| networking | mesh router (esp32 or helium mesh, optional) | $20 | or wifi direct mesh on pi |
| cooling | passive heatsink or fan | $10 | protects compute node in hot environments |
| enclosure | waterproof outdoor box (optional) | $20 | for outdoor or rugged deployment |
| miscellaneous | cables, mounts, fasteners | $15 | solar wiring, mounts, adapters |

---

## total estimated cost per node

> **approximately 430–450 usd per node**

---

## full node forest (7 nodes) estimated cost

> **approximately 3,010–3,150 usd total**

\_note // nodes are decentralised, modular, and scalable. this means you can build out a node forest slowly.

---

## deployment notes

* **energy source**: 100% local renewable (solar microgeneration).
* **ai specialisation**: each node hosts one or more micro-ais dedicated to ecological, linguistic, or social tasks.
* **networking**: decentralised mesh or wifi direct; internet optional, not required.
* **governance**: all node owners participate equally in the commons assembly.

> a grove is not a factory. it is a living system, distributed under sunlight and in the soil.

# appendix b: glossary of terms

---

## grove

a decentralised community of ai nodes rooted in ecological and commons-based principles. each grove operates autonomously but shares knowledge openly.

---

## node forest

a solar-powered cluster of multiple grove nodes, operating like a natural forest — resilient, interconnected, and regenerative.

---

## micro-ai

a lightweight, specialised artificial intelligence model embedded in a node. micro-ais are efficient, transparent, and dedicated to specific tasks (e.g., energy optimisation, climate prediction, translation).

---

## commons assembly

the democratic decision-making body composed of all grove node owners and participants. it governs expansions, upgrades, and philosophical directions of the grove.

---

## seeding

the act of founding a new grove, beginning with one or more nodes and gradually expanding into a fully functional node forest.

---

## regenerative intelligence

the philosophy that ai should actively heal, support, and enrich ecological and social systems—not exploit or dominate them.
