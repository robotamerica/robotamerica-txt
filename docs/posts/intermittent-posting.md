# intermittent posting

*13 Nov, 2025*

in the age of the quick and the cheap, it is expected that those who occupy space online do so in a supposedly hyper-productive way. write, write, write, write! post more often! be busy looking busy. produce more! keep up with the crowd.

ah, it is truly a joyous thing to not be a part of the crowd.

last week, a friend asked me why i don't post more often. i told her, what i will tell you: i have a tremendous amount of hobbies and projects all being balanced precariously upon my adhd [segway: go out and touch the grass!] riddled mind. that segway back there is a huge reason i post fairly intermittently. i am outside touching the grass. when i say it, i mean it!

certainly, i am a digital being. but the internet is a far way from my real life. i just use it to share things i feel are worth sharing. if i am not online, i am outside on a date drinking cocktails, on a photowalk or a hike, printing with my mimeograph machine, printing with my letterpress, making collages with old magazines, writing poetry in a journal, reading a book, having a carne asada with friends, travelling or wandering aimlessly through my city. sure, i have some time to write and post, but i do so only when i feel like it. no pressure.

i am an intermittent poster, damnit, and i am damned proud of it. it is not as if folk are binge-reading websites or logs/blogs. folk tend to read what is fresh or trending. welp, nothing trending here.

posts don't need to be on a schedule, so post when you like. if the attention economy snubs you ... who cares? this is one reason i hate chronological feeds. i don't care what is fresh, if it isn't the news, neither should you.

don't you miss that old sense of discovery? that sense that you found something neat that you used to get before algorithms and feeds? you can feel it again, just don't follow the feeds. search for websites and blogs you're interested in. jump into archives and old posts. get lost in a webring or a blogroll. do all this at random. be a digital flâneur. wander about a little, you'll like what you see on your own. i promise.

as for writers (bloggers or whatever), we need stop pretending to be the new york times. you don't need a posting schedule. especially a daily posting habit. write and play when you want. hopefully the internet will be here tomorrow. if it is, post then or maybe the day after, or even next week or month! become, yourself, an intermittent poster and live a little. touch that grass, kiss someone, drink a glass of wine, write in your journal, damn the man, play a board game, and leave that post until later. no worries.
