# the internet is becoming a digital desert

*31 Dec, 2025*

homogeneity is the new normal. ai generated algorithms and slop rule supreme. everything is an advertisement. we only exist between advertisements, in fleeting moments. god is dead, now culture too. done in by our own greed. it is hard to enshittify, when everything is already shit. but this is capitalism, and here we are.

new year resolution: keep it fun, keep making things, keep exploring ... online and off. damn the man, hack the planet: we shall only be free until the last capitalist is strung up by the entrails of the last tech bro!

shine on beautiful robots. happy new year!
