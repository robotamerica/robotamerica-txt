# a solarpunk ai manifesto

*27 Sep, 2025*

*technology for earth, community, and future*

## AI Today: A Turning Point

**Current Path:** monolithic AI models, massive carbon emissions, resource depletion.  
**Result:** acceleration of ecological collapse.

**Truth:** this does not have to be inevitable. We can choose a different future (Strubell, Ganesh, & McCallum, 2019). It will depend on what we choose to use this technology for.

## Social Media, Advertising, and AI: A Hidden Crisis and a Bad Choice

Today, **social media** is one of the **largest consumers of AI and AI technologies.**.

* Over **80–90%** of the user experience is now **AI-mediated**: feeds, recommendations, ads, moderation, notifications, etc. (Nature Communications, 2022).
* Billions of AI inferences occur every second, consuming **massive continuous energy** globally.
* Social media companies **optimise for attention**, not well-being, ecology, or community.

**Key Environmental Problems:**

* **Energy drain**: Billions of micro-predictions running 24/7, powered by nonrenewable energy grids.
* **Water usage**: Data centre cooling for social platforms uses millions of gallons per year.
* **E-waste**: Accelerated device life cycles are partly driven by social media demand.
* **Carbon emissions**: Cumulative operational carbon load across Meta, TikTok, Google, and other centralised social media platforms are huge.

**Key Social Problems:**

* **Psychological exploitation**: AI predicts and manipulates emotional states to maximise platform engagement (Nature Communications, 2022).
* **Opportunity cost**: AI talent and compute are siphoned into optimising ad clicks, not healing the planet.
* **Centralised control**: Power and profit are concentrated among a few monopolies at enormous ecological and social cost.

> **Social media represents one of the worst ecological and ethical misuses of AI resources in its short history.**

---

## Green AI Principles: Another Way

* **Local First**: Deploy lightweight, decentralised models in the periphery.
* **Renewable Roots**: Train and run AI only on 100% renewable energy (Microsoft, 2024).
* **Small is Beautiful**: Prefer efficient, specialised models over bloated monoliths.
* **Open Access and Commons**: Share AI knowledge freely for ecological good (Climate Change AI, 2019).
* **Carbon Consciousness**: Publicly disclose AI carbon, energy, and water footprints.

## From Dirty AI to Green AI

| Dirty AI | Green AI |
| --- | --- |
| Centralised, opaque, carbon-heavy | Decentralised, transparent, renewable |
| Designed for capitalist incentives | Designed for community and ecology |
| Endless growth at all costs | Regenerative balance with the biosphere |
| Controlled by few | Controlled by many |

---

## Our Future: A Solarpunk AI World

* AI managing solar microgrids for villages and communities (Wildlabs.net, ongoing).
* AI to assist in regenerating forests and monitoring oceans (Wildlabs.net, ongoing).
* Citizen scientists protecting biodiversity using AI (Wildlabs.net, ongoing).
* Community-owned AI training sustainably with a minimal footprint.
* AI-assisted housework and light farm or garden work.
* AI-assisted coding and technological development frameworks.
* AI-assisted labour (mental/physical) to free up time with the specific goal of spending more time outdoors and having more leisure time.
* Decentralised social networks and digital gardens unoptimised by AI.

## Reallocate the Intelligence

Today, vast AI resources are wasted on:

* Addictive content feeds
* Manipulative ad targeting
* Attention mining for profit

At the cost of:

* Ecological collapse
* Psychological exploitation (Nature Communications, 2022)
* Social fragmentation

## Closing Remarks

> We must appropriate machines not be appropriated by them.  
> — Guattari (1989)

> The very notion of the domination of nature by man stems from the very real domination of human by human.  
> — Bookchin (1982)

Technology and AI must become a tool for ecological, social, and mental regeneration, not capitalist exploitation. Decentralised AI can help to democratise its use and mitigate environmental catastrophe. Generalist and monolithic AI will need to be broken up into an ecosystem of specialised and decentralised machines. In principle, this network of machines will still be able to perform and answer general inquiries while also helping us to limit energy consumption, water usage, and planned obsolescence as environmental factors.
